Prototypes for the new PowerShell programming model

Assume that all function apps have requirements.psd1, profile.ps1 local.settings.json, and host.json, unless otherwise specified (in notes.md)

All option 2's have Intellisense on Attributes (hopefully)

Who maintains the binding options? As bindings get updated, does our code need to maintain parity?
